Description: An alluvial plot is a form of sankey diagram and a great tool for 
    visualising categorical data. Their graphical grammar however is a bit more 
    complex then that of a regular x/y plots. The 'ggalluvial' package made a great
    job of translating that grammar into 'ggplot2' syntax and gives you many option
    to tweak the appearance of an alluvial plot, however there still remains 
    a multi-layered complexity that makes it difficult to use 'ggalluvial' for 
    explorative data analysis. 'easyalluvial' provides a simple interface to this 
    package that allows you to produce a decent alluvial plot from any dataframe in 
    either long or wide format from a single line of code while also handling 
    continuous data. It is meant to allow a quick visualisation of entire dataframes 
    with a focus on different colouring options that can make alluvial plots a great 
    tool for data exploration.
