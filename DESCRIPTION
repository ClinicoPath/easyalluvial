Description: Alluvial plots are a form of sankey diagram that are a great tool for 
    visualising categorical data. Their graphical grammar however is a bit more 
    complex then that of a regular x/y plots. The ggalluvial package made a great
    job of translating that grammar into ggplot2 syntax and gives you many option
    to tweak the appearance of an alluvial plot, however the there still remains 
    a multi-layered complexity that makes it difficult to use ggalluvial for 
    explorative data analysis. easyalluvial provides a simple interface to this 
    package that allows you to put out a decent alluvial from any dataframe where
    data is stored in either long or wide format while also handling continuous 
    data. It is meant to allow a quick visualisation of entire dataframes similar 
    to the visualisations created by the tabplot package with a focus on different 
    colouring options that can make alluvials a great tool for data exploration.
