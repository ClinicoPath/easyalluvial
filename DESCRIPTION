Description: Alluvial plots are a form of sankey diagrams that are a great tool for exploring categorical
    data. Their graphical grammar however is a bit mor complex then that of a regular x-y plot. The ggalluvial
    package made a great job of translating that grammar into ggplot2 synthax and gives you many option
    to tweak the appearance of a plot, however the there still remains a multilayered complexity that
    makes it difficult to use ggalluvial for explorative data analysis. easyalluvial provides a simple
    interface to this package that allows you to put out a decent alluvial from any dataframe where
    data is stored in either long or wide format while also handling contineous data. It is meant to allow 
    a quick visualisation of entire dataframes similar to the visualisations created by the tabplot package 
    with a focus on different colouring options that can make alluvials a great tool for data exploration.
